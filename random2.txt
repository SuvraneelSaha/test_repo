some more random nots !! 

by using the git ignore files we could add more files and folder that we need but also dont need 

say i include a file that is useful for me but i dont want the public or anyone to see 

so i can include that file in the git ignore file section 

simple and wonderful 

in case you are wondering why the info.txt , 1.txt and info1.txt file are not shown in the public repository

is because it is in the git_ignore file section 

so they are not gonna be shown on the main branch of the repository
