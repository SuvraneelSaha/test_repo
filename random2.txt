some more random nots !! 


USE case of git_ignore file : 

by using the git ignore files we could add more files and folder that we need but also dont need 

say i include a file that is useful for me but i dont want the public or anyone to see 

so i can include that file in the git ignore file section 

simple and wonderful 

questions to come in mind : 

in case you are wondering why the info.txt , 1.txt and info1.txt file are not shown in the public repository

is because it is in the git_ignore file section 

so they are not gonna be shown on the main branch of the repository




but 2nd point ------ important ----------

see here the two files random1.txt and random2.txt files are shown in the public repository 

the question may come to our mind how and why 

--> both the files random1 and random2 were created before the git_ignore file and were 

first staged then committed on the main public repository 

so for which the git_ignore cannot interfere with them as the are already committed in public repository 

3rd point ------important--------------

when making a file which you will be ignoring in the main public repository 

make sure you dont stage the file in the github desktop 

(make it unchecked )

and then add it to the git_ignore file 


4th point -----------important-----------

when doing negating pattern in git_ignore (unexclude ie not excluding ie including the file )

make sure you type the unignored file right below the main ignoring file_type

ex - 
        *.txt 
        !2.txt
